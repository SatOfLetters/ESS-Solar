                    <p>Solar panels convert daylight into electricity. The energy from the sun excites the electrons in the solar cells and produces an electric charge. An inverter converts the power from a direct current to an alternating current, so it can be used on domestic appliances. This green electricity then flows through the electric wiring in your home to power gadgets, white goods and the lights in your home.</p>

                    <p>Solar PV panels are mounted on metal frames that are connected to an existing roof. They can also be integrated into a new roof. The most cost effective and efficient PV panels come in black or blue. Tile photovoltaics are available however they are more expensive and, at present, not as efficient.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                        <p>Solar panels are very efficient in the UK. Although the efficiency of solar panels is higher on sunny days, they do not need direct sunlight to work. Solar panels can also produce a considerable amount of electricity on cloudy days and during the winter season.</p>
                        <p>In fact, solar panels are more suited to cooler temperatures . Solar panels can overheat in hot countries, and that reduces their efficiency. Therefore, UK weather is ideal for solar panels to work optimally.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                        <p>There are two types of solar panels: PV and thermal. The type most commonly used is photovoltaic solar panels (PV) – these catch the sun’s energy and convert it into electricity. These enable you to power your home appliances. The other type of panel is solar thermal. These enable you to heat water for your home. Most homes will install solar PV as we tend to use far more electricity so this is the most efficient way to cut down on bills.</p>

                        <p>To maximise what your panels can make, you usually need a predominantly south-facing roof. If your roof faces south-west or west you’ll still get some benefit, but it may be less effective and you might not get the maximum savings.</p>

                        <p>Over the years Inverter technology has improved, but not quite enough. The main disadvantage is that the solar panels are still connected in series, so shaded or failed solar panels will affect the yield of the whole string.</p>
                        <p>Optimisation increases the energy output by splitting the system from series to parallel. We offer two options for optimisation both come with online monitoring platforms.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Before you begin the installation process, your installer will need to do a survey of your property. This is an important part of the installation process that will make sure you get a system and design that is right for your property. Your surveyor should assess your property and talk you through your shading analysis (to check shading from nearby trees or objects) for the most accurate projected figures. They should leave you a written, fixed cost quote, including projected performance of your system. You don’t have to commit to anything on the day.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>When you install a solar battery as part of your home solar energy system, you can actually store the extra energy your solar panels produce at home instead of feeding it back into the electricity grid. With solar batteries, you maximize your ability to use the electricity generated by your solar panels on a day-to-day basis. During the times when you need more electricity than your solar panels are producing (later in the day or at nighttime), you can use the solar energy you have stored.</p>

                        <p>Sadly we have all heard horror stories about rogue traders who target vulnerable customers.</p>

                        <p>We are very conscious of the fact that we visit customers in their own homes and that we will inevitably come across potentially vulnerable people so we have a robust policy for identifying these customers and we do everything we can to ensure we protect them.</p>

                        <p>We ask that joint home owners and anyone with an active power of attorney attend the appointments and if customers live alone they are always very welcome to have a family member, friend or neighbour with them. We always let you know who is coming out to see you and all our contractors carry ID. We recommend you check with our office if you have any concerns.</p>

                        <p>We are a reputable and family oriented company, you can check us out at Companies House, our website and social media. You can sign up for email newsletters, and if you’re ever passing our office in</p>

                        <p>Poole, let us know and we will put the kettle on and open a packet of hobnobs (other biscuits are available).</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>We ask that everyone with a legal interest in the home that the system is installed in is present at the appointment. This includes all home owners and anyone who holds an ​active​ power of attorney. We want everyone to be happy with our service and we find that involving everyone in the process is the best way to achieve this.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>We don’t always know, sometimes it is widely known that a particular company has ceased trading, often that is the reason that your details have been passed to us in the first place but we will never claim that your original installer is no longer trading and you should check this out yourself.</p>

                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">How do you decide if my system is at warranty standard? <div></div></button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>We have lots of experience and carry out a risk assessment based on the type and age of the equipment, how well it has been maintained, how likely it is to fail and whether parts can be repaired or replaced. Some parts are no longer manufactured so it would not be possible to offer a warranty if we were unable to source parts in the future.</p>

                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Why do I need to replace my equipment? <div></div></button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Nothing lasts forever unfortunately, solar equipment has a life span and most manufacturers recommend that certain pieces of equipment are replaced at least once during their lifetime. If we have recommended a piece of equipment be replaced it is because it has reached, or is coming to the end of its useful lifespan.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely you can, we will need to inspect the work that has been carried out but provided everything is ok we will issue the warranty. We recommend you do your research and only use a reputable</p>
